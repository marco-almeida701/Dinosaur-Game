# Dinosaur-game
This is a simple Dinosaur Game project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is an infinite runner where the player controls a dinosaur and tries to avoid obstacles by jumping over them.
## Features
* **Jumping:** The player can make the dinosaur jump by clicking anywhere on the screen.
* **Animation:** The dinosaur and the obstacles are animated to provide a more engaging experience.
* **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions between the dinosaur and the obstacles. If a collision occurs, the game ends.
* ## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Used for the structure of the page.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling and layout.**
* **JavaScript:** Used for handling user interactions and game logic.
## How to Play
1. Open the web page in a web browser.
2. Control the dinosaur by clicking anywhere on the screen to make it jump.
3. The objective is to avoid the obstacles (represented by blue-violet blocks) by jumping over them.
4. If the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and an alert will be displayed.
